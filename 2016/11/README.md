# November 2016 - General Discussion

## Topicsp

Chris and I (Tom Purl) were the only ones at the meeting this week so
we had a very informal dicussion about lots of things that were
somewhat related to Linux. Here's some of the highlights:

### Linux From Scratch

I'm working on building my own Linux distribution right now using
LFS. We'll see if it's worth the effort.

- [LFS](http://linuxfromscratch.org/)

### Bitcoin/Lightcoin/Ethereum

We talked a little bit about mining and using a "cold" wallet, along
with interesting recent stories related to the IRS and forking.

- [Bitcoin For The Befuddled](https://www.nostarch.com/bitcoinforthebefuddled) (HIGHLY recommended by me)
- [FAQ: Upcoming Ethereum Hard Fork - Ethereum Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/10/18/faq-upcoming-ethereum-hard-fork/)
- [Bitcoin Users Who Evade Taxes Are Sought by the I.R.S.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/business/dealbook/irs-is-seeking-tax-evaders-who-use-bitcoin.html)

### Kubernetes, containers, and Mesos

Chris and I both are looking to learn a lot more about containers
in 2017, and here's some of the stuff we discussed:

- [Datanauts 058: Kubernetes â€“ A Deep-Dive Introduction](http://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/datanauts-058-kubernetes-deep-dive-introduction/) -
  This podcast is recommended by Chris in general and he said this was
  a pretty good episode.
- [Mesos In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/mesos-in-action) -
  I'm currently reading this book so that I can edit an article for
  the [Sysadvent](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/) blog. It's not too
  bad so far and I wouldn't mind presenting on the topic once I
  actually know something about it.

### Misc

- [Napkin-do](https://napkindo.firebaseapp.com/#/) - This is basically
a free version of MS Paint that's web-hosted. I like using it for
quick whiteboard diagrams and it works well with a tablet.
